## Project C

This mod is for adding space platform combat mechanics. This would be a really interesting mechanic that I don't see anyone making (or at least making it well). The plan is to do something similar to the game FTL or the mod SaveOurShip2 on RimWorld but with an added RTS controls for the space platforms when in combat. Named as "Project C" because I still can't figure out a good title for this.

I am currently writing the boring bits and core functionality of this mod. I have been doing software engineer enough in my life that I know this will take a long-ass time to finish and I prepared myself for the long walk.

## Space Exploration Stuff
This an add-on for the most popular mod in Factorio named Space Exploration. This mod adds a ton of features, recipes, and mechanics to the game that felt missing. I made all the features toggleable so that the player has a choice to remove unwanted features to their game.

This mod has deprecated for a while now and I plan to revive this project and modularize features in the far future when Space Exploration updates to v0.8

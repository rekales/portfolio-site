## Constant Force Linear Actuators
--------------------------------------------------
### Why
In the search for robotic actuators, I've come across many types but none of which was a good analogue for muscles. Most robotic applications use motors with strain-wave gears for compact, high-ratio, and high-precision applications. Or cycloidal gears for heavy-duty applications such as automotive spot welding robotic arms. Often the problem with these is that it has zero compliance, you could use a direct drive motor but that would have pretty weak torque. I can feel the latent demand for this specific part.

#### Voice Coil Actuators
Then after weeks of research I came across voice coil actuators. These are mainly used for speakers and microphones but there are some designs that is designed for speed and precision, one of which was sold by ThorLabs and holy fucking shit that's expensive. I've looked deeper into voice coil actuators and there are no designs that covers my needs so I'll started designing one.

Time for engineering.

### Design Constraints
1.  Cheap :  My robotic designs will contain many of these actuators so keeping it as cheap as possible is a must.
2. Mass-Producible :  Any child within in chinese factory should be able to produce these. It should not require any high precision manufacturing equipment to produce this. I will not produce hundreds of these on my own, I'll have to outsource the manufacturing capability.
3. High-Force :  Just enough force to be able to lift it's own weight and the machine using it.
4. Rugged :  Because the applications that uses these will experience kicks and tumbles.
5. Speed :  It needs to be as fast as meat muscles. I don't think this will be an issue but it's good to have it laid out. 

Precision is not a requirement, if precision is needed then I would just use geared motors.

### Progress
I have done small scale tests to get a better understanding of the mechanics of how voice coil actuators work. I'm now ready to create a prototype but that would have to wait because the parts and tools I need hasn't arrived yet and that might take a while.

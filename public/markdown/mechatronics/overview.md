# Mechatronics Logs & Designs
Here is where I put logs of my work on some of my projects that involve electronics and robotics. Small scale one-off project will not be included like making a cheap Wi-Fi mesh nodes using some chineseum-grade esp32s or building auto-watering system for a planter box.

I've always been interested in electronics and mechanical design way back when I was a kid and have been slowly accumulating knowledge in it. My study on this topic accelerated when our thesis was to literally build a machine and I'm the only one with any prior knowledge on 3D design, electronics, and embedded programming.

## RimScript
A domain specific language designed for controlling objects in the game world. The language is designed to be accessible to typical users with no programming background so the syntax might look a bit weird for the average programmer. Designed the language using formal language theory so that I can fully map out and visualize the parse tree in my head. 
This is a mod and is made as a dependency to the Tasks mod but notable enough to deserve its own project page.

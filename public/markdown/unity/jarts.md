## Just Another Real Time Strategy
Or simply just JARTS.
The RTS genre is stale, newer games of this genre is just using the Blizzard formula of "construct buildings -> produce units -> clash armies" and the innovations in this genre is just better graphics, balancing, and sprinkle of barely unique game mechanics. The focus of the typical Blizzard-esque RTS game is highly precise micro movements and unit compositions.

The goal of this project is to hopefully influence the RTS genre even just slightly by completely overhauling the game mechanic conventions. In this this game, positioning and formation is everything, this will be a test of cognitive capacity instead of mechanical skill by checking how much the player can handle instead. The art style will be geometric and functional (similar to diep.io and shapez) due to the fact that I can't art well.

I am deep in the development of this game, focusing on the core game loop. I will provide details here around a few months when I got something nice to finally show.

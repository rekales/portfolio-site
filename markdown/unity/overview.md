# Unity Game Development
THE most popular game engine in the market. Games here are coded in C# and there's a lot more for me to do and learn.

To summarize how I see game development here, it's very reminiscent of OOP but a heavy focus on object composition, kinda like modern front-end web dev with their component based systems.

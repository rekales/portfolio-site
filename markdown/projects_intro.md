# Projects Overview

Here is the list of my projects grouped by category. I did not include school projects, easy made-on-a-whim side projects, and classified corporate proprietary projects for obvious reasons. 

I make these projects because they don't exist anywhere and there a demand for it, or perhaps latent demand. These are made for fun, or an excuse/reason to learn, or due to my innate desire to innovate as an engineer.

**Some of these may be highly detailed with previews like in the mechatronics category, and some are just short descriptions.**

All my projects are open-source and available for free for everyone.

## Tasks - General Automation Tool
This mod adds a way to automate specific part of your colony because micromanaging every aspect of the game is annoying. Features include letter alerts and events handling and scheduled orders. I will no longer need to micromanage my growth vat to organs pipeline.

People have created mods to automate certain parts of the game (i.e. automatically arming colonists with weapons if there's a raid) but no one has ever tried to create a mod that automates **every** aspect of it.

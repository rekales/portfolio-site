# RimWorld Mod Development
Rimworld, a game about managing a colony. Modding in this game requires knowing XML when doing basic stuff and C# when adding or changing advanced functionality to the base game. 
I noticed that the balance of artist to programmers in this modding community lean a lot more to the artist side hence there's a lot of mods with good looking sprites but no unique mechanics.

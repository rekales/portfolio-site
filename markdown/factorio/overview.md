# Factorio Mod Development

Factorio, one of the best games to ever exists and I implore every programmer in the world to at least try this game once. The mods I made here are varied from simple one-line to amalgamation of complex and hacky ideas. 

I didn't include the mods that I haven't posted on the Factorio mod portal which includes a train logistic system and custom weapon types add-on for a certain mod.

There's no balance between programmers and artist in this modding community, it's all programmers (maybe from the fact that this game attracts technical minded people). I see a very noticable abundance of programmers from the fact that most mod assets here are either recolors, reused textures from another mod, or simply doesn't look great. The mods that have good graphics though have authors who knows how to program AND do art, so rare exceptions.
